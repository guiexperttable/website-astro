        The "GUI Expert Table" is designed to seamlessly integrate with <span class="text-primary">Angular</span>
        but also works with <span class="text-primary">plain JavaScript,
        React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, and Solid</span>. It is framework-agnostic. </p>

      <p>
        The underlying UI model is highly flexible, allowing you to create a wide range of tables, including
        <span class="text-primary">flat
          tables, tree tables</span>, columns with rowspan cells, and much more. </p>
      <p>
        "GUI Expert Table" can be easily used for simple flat tables with the help of the table model factory helper,
        but it's also suitable for handling very complex tables.
        It has been <span class="text-primary">optimized for performance</span>, making it ideal
        for managing <span class="text-primary">large datasets</span> or handling real-time updates
        with hundreds of updates per second, all rendered at
        60 frames per second (fps). </p>
