## Basic Feature Comparison

Comparing data table libraries proves challenging due to diverse features, licensing models, community support, and
pricing structures across platforms like Handsontable, ag-Grid, GuiExpert, Tabulator, Grid.js, and FancyGrid. Each
offers unique functionalities, varying from sorting, filtering, and pagination to distinct customization levels.
Differences in licensing, including commercial and free options, further complicate comparison. Additionally, community
size and engagement differ, impacting available resources for support and development. Each library's specific strengths
and weaknesses, tailored to different user needs and preferences, contribute to the complexity of making direct
comparisons between these versatile tools.

A formal comparison of individual features seems futile, as all libraries support common features comprehensively.
