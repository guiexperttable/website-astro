A short comparison of some of the top framework agnostic data tables in 2024. Here are some of the criteria that I used
to compare them:

- **Features:** The number and quality of features that the data table offers, such as sorting, filtering, pagination,
  editing, exporting, etc.
- **Performance:** The speed and efficiency of the data table, especially when handling large or complex data sets.
- **Documentation:** The availability and clarity of the documentation and examples for the data table.
- **Community:** The popularity and activity of the data table among developers and users, as well as the support and
  feedback channels.

Based on these criteria, I have selected four data table libraries that I think are among the top choices in 2024:
Tabulator, DataTables, Grid.js, and SlickGrid. Here is a brief comparison of them:

| Library    | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Performance                                                                                                                                                                                              | Documentation                                                                                                                                                                              | Community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
